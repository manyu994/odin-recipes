    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dal Tadka is a popular Indian lentil dish made with toor dal (split pigeon peas) or a mix of lentils, cooked until soft, 
        and then infused with a flavorful tempering of ghee, garlic, onions, tomatoes, and aromatic spices. This comforting dish
        is best enjoyed with rice or roti and is a staple in Indian households and restaurants alike.
        The word <em>Tadka</em> refers to the tempering process where mustard seeds, cumin, and other spices are fried in ghee or oil
        to release their flavors before being poured over the cooked dal. This simple yet rich dish is easy to make and packed 
        with nutrition, making it perfect for a wholesome meal</p>
